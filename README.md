# ðŸ«˜ Natto - a hobby API service

**Natto** is a multi-purpose hobby API service that provides access to various personal interests and collections. It mainly focuses on Asian artists from the [Getty Research Institute's Union List of Artist NamesÂ® (ULAN) database](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan), but also includes multiple API endpoints covering different personal interests including a directory of art galleries in Aotearoa, my books, Tomica car collections et al.

I'm using this project to learn more about [Hono](https://hono.dev/) and what it is capable of just as a bit of fun!

## About the data

Natto contains multiple datasets across different domains:

### Artists from Asia
The artist data is derived from the ULAN database, which contains authoritative information about artists and their biographical details. The data includes:

- Artist names and full names
- Nationality codes and geographic origins
- Artist types and classifications
- Biographical descriptions
- Hierarchical relationships between artists
- Information on submitter

Currently it contains over a million records stored in a single SQLite database, with more being added over time.

### Galleries
Gallery data includes information about art galleries and exhibition spaces:

- Gallery names and descriptions
- Physical addresses and contact information
- Geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude)
- Associated artists
- Opening year and operational status
- Website and email contact details

### Planned Collections
Additional datasets are planned for:

- **Books**: Personal book collection with titles, authors, genres, and descriptions
- **Cars**: Tomica die-cast car collection with models, brands, years, and colours

## Stack

Natto uses the following awesome technologies:

- **Framework**: [Hono](https://hono.dev/) - Fast web framework by [Yusuke Wada](https://github.com/yusukebe)
- **Database**: SQLite/LibSQL with [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
- **Tests**: [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
- **Linter**: [Oxlint](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter.html) - Incredibly fast linter
- **Runtime**: Cloudflare Workers (although Hono and everything else here will happily run anywhere!)

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or bun

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start development server
bun dev

# Run tests
bun test

# Lint code
bun run lint
```

### Deployment

```bash
# Build and deploy to Cloudflare Workers
bun run deploy

# Generate Cloudflare types
bun run cf-typegen
```

### Configuration

The application uses Cloudflare Workers bindings for database configuration:

```ts
// src/index.ts
const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: CloudflareBindings }>();
```

Required environment variables:

- `DATABASE_URL` - LibSQL database connection URL
- `DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN` - Database authentication token
