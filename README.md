# Natto (formerly Artists from Asia)

**Natto** is a specialised API service that provides comprehensive access to Asian artists from around the world, sourced from the [Getty Research Institute's Union List of Artist NamesÂ® (ULAN) database](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan). Rather than mirroring the existing database, this service focuses exclusively on artists from all regions of Asia, including Central, North, South, West, East, and Southeast Asia over fewer data fields for simplicity.

## About the data

The artist data in Natto is derived from the ULAN database, which contains authoritative information about artists and their biographical details. The data includes:

- Artist names and full names
- Nationality codes and geographic origins
- Artist types and classifications
- Biographical descriptions
- Hierarchical relationships between artists
- Information on submitter

Currently it contains over a million records stored in a single SQLite database, with more being added over time.

### Attribution and thanks

This project contains information from the J. Paul Getty Trust, Getty Research Institute, the Union List of Artist Names, which is made available under the ODC Attribution License. The Getty Vocabulary data is compiled from various contributors using published sources; the contributor and sources are available as part of each record.

- **Database**: SQLite/LibSQL with [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
- **Tests**: [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
- **Linter**: [Oxlint](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter.html) - Incredibly fast linter
- **Runtime**: Cloudflare Workers (although Hono and everything else here will happily run anywhere!)

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or bun

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start development server
bun dev

# Run tests
bun test

# Lint code
bun run lint
```

### Deployment

```bash
# Build and deploy to Cloudflare Workers
bun run deploy

# Generate Cloudflare types
bun run cf-typegen
```

### Configuration

The application uses Cloudflare Workers bindings for database configuration:

```ts
// src/index.ts
const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: CloudflareBindings }>();
```

Required environment variables:

- `DATABASE_URL` - LibSQL database connection URL
- `DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN` - Database authentication token
